# Welcome to Junrong Yan's homepage


## About me
I started my undergraduate training in 2013 at School of Mathematical Science, Nankai University, Tianjin, China.


I am currently a Ph. D. candidate at University of California, Santa Barbar, since 2017. My advisor is [Xianzhe Dai](http://web.math.ucsb.edu/~dai/)

### Email Address: 
[j_yan@math.ucsb.edu](j_yan@math.ucsb.edu) 

## Research
My main interests are geometric analysis, PDEs and mathematical physics. More concretely, I am tring to understand QFT and string theory from index theoretic point of view.
### Here are the projects that I am currently working on

#### Analytic torsion for Witten Laplacian on noncompact manifolds
This is a joint project with [Xianzhe Dai](http://web.math.ucsb.edu/~dai/).
#### Nonsemiclassical Weyl's law on noncompact manifolds
This is a joint project with [Xianzhe Dai](http://web.math.ucsb.edu/~dai/).
#### BCOV torsion for LG models
This is a joint project with [Xianzhe Dai](http://web.math.ucsb.edu/~dai/) and [Xinxing Tang](http://ymsc.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/content/show/146-253.html).
#### Renormalization theory and its application to BCOV theory
This is a joint project with [Si Li](https://sili-math.github.io/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/j-yan783/j-yan783.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
