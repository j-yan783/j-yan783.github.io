## About me

I started my undergraduate training in 2013 at School of Mathematical Science, Nankai University, Tianjin, China.

I am currently a Ph. D. candidate at University of California, Santa Barbara, since 2017. My advisor is [Xianzhe Dai](http://web.math.ucsb.edu/~dai/).

Besides mathematics, I enjoy playing the card game Yu-Gi-Oh , cycling and swimming.

## Research

My main interests are geometric analysis, PDEs and mathematical physics. More concretely, I attempt to understand QFT and string theory from index theoretic point of view. See my [Research Statement](Research_Statement (2).pdf) for more details.
